# Question
`fetch` returns a promise of the `Response` object. It has a lot of useful properties on it. Can you explain what each of these properties are for?

- `Response.ok`
- `Response.status`
- `Response.url`
- `Response.headers`

# Answer

1. `Response.ok` - This property is a boolean that returns true or false depending if the status code falls within "successful response" which is 200-299.

2. `Response.status` - This property represents the status code which will tell us about how the requested was processed. This property can relay information about redirection, success, or errors made.

3. `Response.url` - This property holds the URL of the response.

4. `Response.headers` - This property holds an object that includes important information about the data of the response. It can include things such as content type.
