3. 204 - This code indicates that the request was successfullt fulfilled but there is no new data to return. This can happen when a server is requested to DELETE some data.

4. 404 - This code indicates that the given url is invalid or leads to information that does not exist. The server cannot fulfill the request because it cannot access the resource.

5. 500 - This code represents an unexpected situation that the server ran into but does not know to react or resolve-- therefore preventing it from fulfilling the request.
