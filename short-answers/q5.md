# Question
What are the two arguments that we pass into `fetch` and what do they do? What does `fetch` return?

# Answer
The two arguments passed into `fetch` will be the url and an optional object. The only required argument, url, is the resource or link to the API of the data we want to access. The secondary agrument acts as a way to convey the desired the HTTP request verb (what to do with the data), but it is important to note that `fetch ` has a default request being GET. `fetch` returns a promise that has the HTTP response.
